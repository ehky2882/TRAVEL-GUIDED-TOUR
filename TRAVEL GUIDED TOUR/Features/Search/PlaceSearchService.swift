/// Search-as-you-type place lookup backed by `MKLocalSearchCompleter`.
///
/// **Why the completer instead of `MKLocalSearch` per keystroke:** the
/// completer is Apple's purpose-built autocompletion engine — it streams
/// cheap title/subtitle suggestions almost instantly as the query
/// fragment changes, rather than running a full local-search network
/// round-trip on every character (which commonly takes 0.5–1.5s and was
/// the source of the typing lag). The expensive `MKLocalSearch` resolve,
/// which yields the actual coordinate/region the map flies to, now runs
/// **once — only when the user taps a suggestion**. Type-ahead feels
/// live; the network cost moves to selection-time.
///
/// Apple's service is hit directly — no third-party deps, no Atlas
/// backend — consistent with the app's existing MapKit/CoreLocation use.
/// Not `@MainActor`-annotated: `MKLocalSearchCompleter` already delivers
/// its delegate callbacks on the main thread, and every call site (the
/// SwiftUI view) is main-isolated — so the observable state is only ever
/// touched on main. Keeping the class non-isolated avoids the delegate
/// conformance crossing an actor boundary.
