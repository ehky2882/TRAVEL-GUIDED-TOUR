## Owner direction (May 2026)

Principles that override everything else in this file:

1. **Functionality first; design and tone deferred.** Don't burn
   cycles on color palettes, typography, app icons, custom map pins,
   or final editorial tone. Get the audio-tour experience working end
   to end, then polish.
2. **Build so the deferred design pass is cheap.** All new code uses
   `Theme/Atlas{Colors,Typography,Spacing}.swift` tokens even though
   their values are placeholders. The future design decision should be
   a 3-file change, not a 60-file rewrite.
3. **V1 is consumer-side only, backend-free.** Per the spec, payments,
   accounts, and in-app maker upload are post-V1. The V1 UI is built
   in the *shape* of the eventual creator platform so nothing the
   consumer sees needs to be redesigned later.
4. **Review workflow.** Owner reviews via iOS Simulator or TestFlight,
   not by reading code. Each milestone ends in a runnable, reviewable
   state.

---

## Where we are right now

**Status (2026-05-18):** every V1 functionality milestone is shipped
on `main` (M1–M3, M-data-model, M-audio-foundation, M-tour-detail,
M-player, M-home, M-search, M-maker, M-library, M-geofencing,
M-offline; M-map was cut). A home-screen redesign landed as PR #19.
PR #20 (this branch) lands the M-launch-content authoring scaffold
+ CONTRIBUTING.md + doc-hygiene rule.

What's left for V1: **M-launch-content** (owner records audio +
authors real `Tours.json` — full scaffold ready in `docs/` and
`scripts/`), **M-qa** (end-to-end sanity sweep on a real device),
plus the deferred **design / polish pass**. A parked
`claude/alltrails-alignment` branch holds an exploratory
AllTrails-style home redesign to revisit during the design pass —
see "Parked work" below.

**Parked work: `claude/alltrails-alignment` branch.** A second-pass
home redesign exploring an AllTrails-style direction. Three commits
on top of `4f6beb6` (M-offline, #18), dated 2026-05-16/17. Net
change vs `main` after PR #20 lands: roughly +700/-400 lines across
9 files. Polished work, not WIP despite the middle commit's name —
uses theme tokens, doc comments, accessibility labels.

What's on the branch:
- `Components/AtlasTabBar.swift` (new) — custom tab bar replacing
  SwiftUI's `TabView` chrome, shaped to match the home drawer's
  width/inset/corners so they read as one "floating island."
- `Features/Home/CategoryChipRow.swift` (new) — horizontal-scroll
  category filter chips.
- `Features/Home/TourListCard.swift` (new) — larger card for the
  drawer's vertical tour list (replaces horizontal rail carousels).
- `Theme/AtlasSpacing.swift` — adds `phoneScreenRadius` token (48pt)
  for the floating-island shape.
- Heavy rework of `Features/Home/HomeView.swift`,
  `Features/Home/HomeMapSection.swift`, `Components/BottomSheet.swift`,
  `ContentView.swift` to wire the new pieces together.
- Recenter button on the map.

Why it's parked, not merged: per the project's deferred-design
discipline, this branch is a substantial design direction
commitment (chips + vertical list vs. PR #19's rail carousels) that
should be A/B-evaluated on a real device alongside the design pass,
not merged on faith. Main currently has the simpler PR #19 home as
the "good enough for V1" baseline.

How to revive when the design pass starts:
1. `git fetch origin claude/alltrails-alignment`
2. `git rebase main` on the branch (drops the now-redundant copy of
   the PR #19 home-redesign commit, since main already has it via
   the #19 squash).
3. Build to a real device; A/B the result against current main's
   home.
4. If keeping: open it as a PR. If not: extract any universally-good
   pieces (the custom tab bar and recenter button are arguably
   non-controversial), then delete the branch.

**Pivot history.** The previous editorial-city-guide V1 work was
mostly reshaped, not thrown out. The migration tables below are kept
for historical reference; everything in them shipped.

What survives:

| Survives the pivot | Status |
|---|---|
| `TabView` scaffolding (M1) | ✅ Done — originally 5 tabs, trimmed to 3 (Home / Library / Me) in PR #15 when M-map was cut |
| Location permission + `LocationManager` (M3) | ✅ Done — still needed for "near you" + geofencing |
| Environment-shelf pattern (DataService, LibraryStore, LocationManager, AudioPlayerService, …) | ✅ Done — same pattern; new services slot in |
| `TRAVEL_GUIDED_TOURApp.swift`, splash, project.pbxproj basics | ✅ Done |
| `Components/HeroImageView.swift`, theme tokens, platform helpers | ✅ Done |

What got replaced or rewritten (all ✅ shipped):

| Replaced | Replaced by | In milestone |
|---|---|---|
| `Models/{City,Place,PlaceCategory,PlaceCollection}.swift` | `Models/{Tour,Stop,Maker,LibraryEntry,TourCategory,RecentSearch}.swift` | M-data-model |
| `Resources/SeedData.json` (45 editorial places) | `Resources/Tours.json` (seed entries; real content pending M-launch-content) | M-data-model + M-launch-content |
| `Data/DataService.swift` | Reshaped to load tours instead of cities + places | M-data-model |
| `Data/CollectionStore.swift` | Renamed to `LibraryStore` (shape: `[LibraryEntry]`) | M-library |
| `Data/SeedData.swift` | Renamed to `ToursData.swift` | M-data-model |
| `Features/Discover/` | `Features/Home/` — map-dominant home with curated rails | M-home |
| `Features/City/` | Cut (no "city as entity" in this product) | M-data-model |
| `Features/Place/PlaceDetailView.swift` | `Features/Tour/TourDetailView.swift` | M-tour-detail |
| `Features/Collections/` | `Features/Library/` (saved + downloaded + recently played) | M-library |
| `Features/Map/` | **Cut entirely** — Home's embedded map is sufficient | M-map (cut) |
| Existing `Location/ProximityMonitor.swift` | Reshaped to monitor stop geofences | M-geofencing |

What got added net-new (all ✅ shipped):

- `Audio/AudioPlayerService.swift` — `AVQueuePlayer` wrapper + lock-screen integration
- `Audio/TourDownloader.swift` — offline audio caching via `URLSession`
- `Features/Player/PlayerView.swift` — full-screen audio player
- `Features/Maker/MakerView.swift` — maker bio + their tour list
- `Features/Search/{SearchView,SearchBar}.swift` + `Data/RecentSearchStore.swift`
- `Data/RecentlyViewedStore.swift` — drives the "Recently viewed" home rail
- `Features/Settings/ManageDownloadsView.swift` — storage management for downloaded tours
- `Components/BottomSheet.swift` — persistent bottom sheet used by the home redesign
- `UIBackgroundModes: audio` build setting (audio continues with phone locked)
- `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` build setting (geofence triggers in background)

---

## V1 — Functionality milestones (in execution order)

### M1–M3. Build infrastructure — ✅ Done

These three milestones built the structural shell that survives the
audio-tour pivot. Brief status:

| | Status |
|---|---|
| **M1. Wire ContentView (5-tab TabView)** | ✅ Done in PR #2. Tab *contents* will change in later milestones; 5-tab skeleton stays. |
| **M2. Populate seed data file** | ✅ Done in commit `890b10c`. The 45-place editorial file gets replaced by `Tours.json` in M-data-model — but the infrastructure for loading JSON at launch survives. |
| **M3. Location privacy string** | ✅ Done (build setting). The copy will likely be tweaked for the audio-tour framing during M-home — small change. |

---

### M-data-model. New data model — Tour, Stop, Maker, LibraryEntry, TourCategory, RecentSearch — ✅ Done (PR #6)

**What:** Add the new Swift model types described in
`atlas_claude_code_prompt.md` § Data Model. Add a one- or two-tour
`Tours.json` for shape testing. Reshape `DataService` to load it.
Delete the old `City` / `Place` / `PlaceCategory` /
`PlaceCollection` models.

**Why:** Every later milestone depends on this shape. The previous
data model doesn't fit the audio-tour product at all.

**Files touched:**
- `Models/Tour.swift`, `Models/Stop.swift`, `Models/Maker.swift`,
  `Models/LibraryEntry.swift` (new)
- `Models/TourCategory.swift` (new — closed enum of categories that
  drive the home screen's interest-based rails; spec § TourCategory)
- `Models/RecentSearch.swift` (new — local-only record of a search
  query, used by the "Because you searched [X]" rail; spec §
  RecentSearch)
- `Resources/Tours.json` (new — shape-test content only; real content
  arrives in M-launch-content)
- `Data/DataService.swift` (reshape)
- `Data/SeedData.swift` (rename → `Data/ToursData.swift` or rewrite
  in place)
- `Resources/SeedData.json` (delete once `Tours.json` works)
- `Models/{City,Place,PlaceCategory,PlaceCollection}.swift` (delete)

**Expected fallout:** Most existing views (`DiscoverView`,
`CityDetailView`, `PlaceDetailView`, `MapView`, `CollectionsView`)
break at compile time after the model swap. That's expected — the
next milestones rewrite them. To keep the app buildable mid-milestone,
the views can be stubbed to "Coming soon" placeholders until their
own milestone lands.

**How we know it worked:** App compiles; `DataService` exposes
`tours: [Tour]` on the environment; a debug print confirms tours
loaded.

---

### M-audio-foundation. Audio playback infrastructure — ✅ Done (PR #7)

**What:** Wire up audio playback as a foundation every later milestone
will use.

- Add `Audio/AudioPlayerService.swift` (`@Observable`, on the
  environment shelf) wrapping `AVQueuePlayer`.
- Configure `AVAudioSession` with `.playback` category (audio
  continues with phone locked, ducks other audio appropriately).
- Add `UIBackgroundModes` → `audio` to Info.plist build settings.
- Wire `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` and `MPRemoteCommandCenter` for play /
  pause / scrub / skip-forward / skip-backward from lock screen,
  headphones, AirPods, and CarPlay.

**Why:** Audio playback is the product's core feature; everything
downstream is wallpaper around it. Best to get the iOS plumbing right
once.

**Files touched:**
- `Audio/AudioPlayerService.swift` (new)
- `project.pbxproj` (add `UIBackgroundModes` build setting)
- `TRAVEL_GUIDED_TOURApp.swift` (instantiate service, place on
  environment)

**How we know it worked:** A throwaway test view plays a known remote
audio URL → audio plays → lock phone → audio continues → unlock →
lock-screen controls show the playing audio with title/artwork → tap
pause from lock screen → audio pauses.

---

### M-tour-detail. Tour detail screen — ✅ Done (PR #8)

**What:** Build `TourDetailView`. Replaces `PlaceDetailView`. Shows
hero image, title, maker (tappable, links to `MakerView`), length,
walking distance, stops list, intro audio, Start / Download / Save
buttons.

**Files touched:**
- `Features/Tour/TourDetailView.swift` (new)
- `Features/Place/` (delete)

**How we know it worked:** A hardcoded navigation entry point opens
the detail for a specific tour ID. All fields render. Tapping Start
calls `AudioPlayerService` and starts playing the intro (or stop 1 if
no intro).

---

### M-player. Full-screen audio player — ✅ Done (PR #9)

**What:** The screen consumers will spend the most time on. Shows
hero image, scrub bar, play/pause, speed control (1x / 1.25x / 1.5x /
2x), next-stop / previous-stop, stops list with the current stop
highlighted, and (for geofenced tours) distance-to-next-stop.

**Files touched:**
- `Features/Player/PlayerView.swift` (new)

**How we know it worked:** From `TourDetailView`, tap Start → player
pushes onto navigation stack → audio plays → scrub bar tracks position
→ tapping a different stop jumps playback → "next stop" button
advances correctly.

---

### M-home. Map-dominant home screen with curated rails — ✅ Done (PR #10; redesigned in PR #19)

> Follow-up after PR #19's full-screen-map redesign: "Because you
> searched [X]" rail data is captured by `RecentSearchStore` but not
> yet surfaced in `HomeRailsViewModel`. Tracked in HANDOFF.md.

**What:** Build the new home screen, modeled on the Airbnb landing
page pattern. See `atlas_claude_code_prompt.md` § Key screens #1 for
the design contract. Major pieces:

1. **Search bar pinned to the top** above the map (taps to open the
   M-search results screen).
2. **Map** filling the upper portion of the screen, with tour-stop
   pins. Centered on the user's location, or a sensible default if
   denied / unavailable. Panning the map updates the location-anchored
   rails below.
3. **Curated horizontal-scroll rails** filling the lower portion.
   Three rail families:
   - **Location-anchored:** "Near you" (uses `LocationManager`),
     and "In [city/area in view]" that recomputes when the map pans.
   - **Personalized:** "Continue listening" (`LibraryEntry.listenedSeconds > 0
     && completedAt == nil`), "Recently viewed" (small local cache),
     "Because you searched [X]" (from `RecentSearch`).
   - **Interest-based:** one rail per `TourCategory` — "History,"
     "Architecture," "Art," etc. Hide rails with zero matching tours.

Also: tweak the location-permission copy in build settings to match
the audio-tour framing.

**Files touched:**
- `Features/Home/HomeView.swift` (new)
- `Features/Home/HomeMapSection.swift` (new — map at top, with pan
  detection that updates rail state)
- `Features/Home/RailCarousel.swift` (new — reusable horizontal-
  scroll rail component used by every rail family)
- `Features/Home/HomeRailsViewModel.swift` (new — computes which
  rails to surface, sorts tours within each rail)
- `Features/Discover/` (delete after move)
- `ContentView.swift` (point Home tab at the new view)
- `project.pbxproj` (update `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` copy)

**How we know it worked:** Set simulated location to NYC → map opens
on NYC with pins → "Near you" rail shows NYC tours → category rails
show interest-organized tours. Pan map to Lisbon → location-anchored
rails recompute. Deny location → map opens on a sensible default
view, location-anchored rails fall back to "Browse all" or hide.

---

### M-search. Search bar + results screen — ✅ Done (PR #11)

**What:** Minimal V1 search that powers the home screen's search bar
and the "Because you searched [X]" rail.

- Search bar in the home header opens a full-screen search results
  view.
- Matches on `Tour.title`, `Maker.displayName`, and
  `Tour.primaryCategory` (display name of the category).
- No filters, facets, fuzzy matching, sorting options, or saved
  searches — explicitly deferred per the spec's out-of-scope list.
- Successful queries (i.e., the user opens a tour from the results)
  are appended to local `RecentSearch` history. Cap stored at 20;
  oldest fall off.

**Files touched:**
- `Features/Search/SearchView.swift` (new — results screen)
- `Features/Search/SearchBar.swift` (new — the pinned bar component
  used in `HomeView`)
- `Data/RecentSearchStore.swift` (new — local persistence for
  `RecentSearch` records)

**How we know it worked:** Tap search bar → results screen opens.
Type "history" → tours with `primaryCategory == .history` appear.
Type a maker name → that maker's tours appear. Tap a result → tour
detail opens → return to home → "Because you searched [X]" rail
now shows the query.

---

### M-map. Standalone map screen — ❌ Cut (PR #15)

Cut by owner decision. Home's embedded map (and then the full-screen
map in the PR #19 redesign) covers the spatial-discovery need; a
separate Map tab was redundant. The former Messages tab also got
absorbed into Settings as a row in the same cut, dropping the shell
from 5 tabs to 3 (Home / Library / Me). `Features/Map/` was deleted.

---

### M-maker. Maker page — ✅ Done (PR #12)

**What:** New `MakerView` shows avatar, bio, and the list of that
maker's tours. Linked from `TourDetailView`'s maker attribution.

**Files touched:**
- `Features/Maker/MakerView.swift` (new)

**How we know it worked:** From tour detail, tap the maker's name →
maker page renders → tap one of their tours → tour detail opens.

---

### M-library. Library tab — Saved / Downloaded / Recently played — ✅ Done (PR #13)

**What:** Replace `CollectionsView` with `LibraryView`. Three sections:
**Saved** (bookmarked tours), **Downloaded** (audio cached on device),
**Recently played** (resume listening). Replace `CollectionStore`
with `LibraryStore` (data shape changes from `[PlaceCollection]` to
`[LibraryEntry]`).

**Files touched:**
- `Features/Library/LibraryView.swift` (new)
- `Features/Library/{Saved,Downloaded,RecentlyPlayed}Section.swift`
  (new)
- `Features/Collections/` (delete after move)
- `Data/CollectionStore.swift` → rename / rewrite as `LibraryStore`
- `ContentView.swift` (point Library tab at the new view)

**How we know it worked:** Save a tour from `TourDetailView` → it
appears in Library → Saved. Force-quit + relaunch → still there.
Recently-played history reflects what you actually played.

---

### M-geofencing. GPS-triggered stop playback — ✅ Done (PR #17)

> Always-location decision: shipped with both
> `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` and
> `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` set, so geofences
> can fire while the app is backgrounded / phone locked.

**What:** For multi-stop tours where the maker set stops to
`.geofenced` mode, automatically play the next stop's audio when the
user enters that stop's geofence (default 30m radius). Reuse the
existing `ProximityMonitor` shape with the new `Stop` model. Fire a
local notification when the geofence triggers in the background.

**Files touched:**
- `Location/ProximityMonitor.swift` (rework for stop geofences)
- `Audio/AudioPlayerService.swift` (handle geofence-triggered enqueue)
- `project.pbxproj` (likely needs
  `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` for background
  geofencing — owner-facing decision: do we ask for "always" location,
  or accept that geofencing only works while the app is foregrounded?)

**Open question for owner at start of this milestone:** "Always"
location is more powerful (geofences work with the phone locked) but
a heavier permission ask. "When-in-use" works while the player is on
screen but stops when the app backgrounds. Recommended: ask for
when-in-use first; prompt for always-allow only once the user starts
a multi-stop geofenced tour, with copy that explains the tradeoff.

**How we know it worked:** Simulator with simulated location moving
along a tour's stops → audio for stop N plays as the user arrives at
stop N. Phone locked → same behavior + a local notification.

---

### M-offline. Tour download for offline playback — ✅ Done (PR #18)

**What:** "Download for offline" on tour detail downloads all of the
tour's audio files (and intro) to the app sandbox. Player prefers the
local file when available. Downloaded tours appear in Library →
Downloaded with an offline indicator. Settings includes a "Manage
downloads" view for deleting cached tours and seeing storage usage.

**Files touched:**
- `Audio/TourDownloader.swift` (new — `URLSession` background
  downloads)
- `Features/Tour/TourDetailView.swift` (Download button + progress
  ring)
- `Features/Library/DownloadedToursSection.swift`
- `Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift` (Manage downloads link)

**How we know it worked:** Download a tour → put phone in airplane
mode → start the tour → audio plays end to end without buffering.

---

### M-launch-content. Record 5–15 audio tours / pieces

**Owner milestone — not Claude work.** The Atlas team:

- Picks 5–15 locations / themes (mix of single-piece + multi-stop)
- Writes scripts
- Records audio
- Edits and masters
- Captures stop coordinates and trigger preferences
- Uploads audio to the chosen CDN
- Writes maker bios + tour descriptions
- Authors the final `Tours.json` entries

**Authoring scaffold (ready):**
- `docs/authoring-tours.md` — UI-agnostic field-by-field guide
  (every `Tour` / `Stop` / `Maker` field, decision tips, validation
  checklist, quick workflow). Doubles as the spec for the future
  in-app maker upload form.
- `docs/Tours.template.json` — two filled-in example tours
  (single-piece + multi-stop) showing every field. Copy from this
  when authoring real entries.
- `scripts/validate-tours.swift` — pre-commit safety net. Catches
  typos, duplicate UUIDs, broken maker refs, kind ↔ stop count
  mismatches, coord-range errors, audio-duration math problems
  before they crash the app at launch. Run manually with
  `swift scripts/validate-tours.swift` or wire into a git
  pre-commit hook (one-liner in `docs/authoring-tours.md`).

**Hand-off shape:** Once `Tours.json` is updated with real content and
audio URLs resolve, the rest of the app should "just work" — no code
changes required if the prior milestones held to the data contract.

**Audio hosting (decided 2026-05-18):** GitHub Releases for the
design / prototype phase; switch to Cloudflare R2 before public
release. Full reasoning and switch-triggers in `docs/cdn-decision.md`
§ Status. Owner manages Releases uploads; URLs slot into
`Tours.json` like any other HTTPS URL — no code changes required
to use either path.

---

### M-qa. V1 functionality sanity pass

**What:** End-to-end walkthrough of the running app with real content
loaded. Functional checklist:

1. App launches → map-dominant home with pins, search bar, and
   curated rails below the map (or graceful fallback if no location).
2. Pan the map → location-anchored rails recompute for the new area.
3. Tap the search bar → results screen works (title / maker /
   category match). Open a tour from search → return to home →
   "Because you searched [X]" rail now reflects the query.
4. Tap a tour (pin, rail, or search) → tour detail → tap Start →
   audio plays.
5. Lock the phone → audio continues; lock-screen controls work.
6. Multi-stop geofenced tour → simulated walking along stops → next
   stop's audio triggers on arrival.
7. Multi-stop manual tour → tap next stop in player → its audio plays.
8. Download a tour → airplane mode → tour plays end to end.
9. Save a tour → force-quit + relaunch → still saved.
10. Maker page → tour list correct → tap tour → tour detail opens.

**Files touched:** none expected. Bugs become small targeted fixes.

**Outcome:** V1 ready for owner review via TestFlight, or for the
polish phase below.

**Pre-QA self-audit (2026-05-18).** Before M-qa actually runs on
device, a code self-audit (`docs/pre-qa-audit-260518.md`, landed
via PR #21) surfaced 22 findings — bugs, fragile edges,
accessibility gaps, polish — categorized P0 (launch blockers) →
P3 (polish/debt). Running status; check items off as fixes land:

**P0 — Launch blockers**
- [x] P0-1. Home → Tour Detail navigation silently broken (PR #23)
- [x] P0-2. Dark Mode catastrophically broken (PR #22)
- [x] P0-3. Typography hierarchy collapsed (PR #22)
- [x] P0-4. SettingsView 23 hardcoded `.foregroundStyle(.black)` (PR #22)
- [x] P0-5. Geofenced playback fails offline for downloaded tours (PR #24)
- [x] P0-6. Geofence notifications invisible in foreground (PR #24)
- [/] P0-7. Developer-facing copy in user UI — HomeView + LibraryView fixed in PR #23. SettingsView debug-counts row deferred to a follow-up after PR #22.

**P1 — Bugs**
- [ ] P1-1. "Continue listening" / "Recently played" sort by wrong field
- [ ] P1-2. Maker avatar URL is ignored (lands with P1-4)
- [ ] P1-3. Player-tour identification by title is fragile
- [ ] P1-4. HeroImageView doesn't load remote images (depends on CDN pick)
- [x] P1-5. Audio session interruption (phone call) not handled (PR #24)
- [x] P1-6. Headphone unplug doesn't pause audio (PR #24)
- [ ] P1-7. International-dateline bug in coordinate-in-region check

**P2 — Accessibility**
- [ ] P2-1. BottomSheet has no VoiceOver affordance
- [ ] P2-2. Map preview close button sub-44pt touch target
- [ ] P2-3. Download button disabled state not announced
- [ ] P2-4. No "Open Settings" deep link when location denied
- [ ] P2-5. Localization gap — duration / distance formatters hardcoded English/metric

**P3 — Polish & tech debt:** ten items; see audit doc. None block V1.

**Lifecycle.** Once every P0 + P1 from the audit is closed (or
explicitly deferred), archive `docs/pre-qa-audit-260518.md` to
`archive/` per the doc-hygiene rule. The closed PRs are the
record; this checklist is the live "what's left."

---

## V1 — Development infrastructure

| Milestone | Scope |
|---|---|
| **M-tests.** XCTest unit suite + CI | Cover the data/logic layer (`LibraryStore`, `HomeRailsViewModel`, `RecentSearchStore`, `RecentlyViewedStore`, `TourCategory`, `ToursData` decoding) with XCTest. GitHub Actions workflow runs the validator + `xcodebuild build` + `xcodebuild test` on every PR. Test target needs a one-time Xcode wiring step by the owner — see `TRAVEL GUIDED TOURTests/README.md`. **Status:** test files + workflow on `claude/m-tests-260518`; pending owner adding the Unit Testing Bundle target in Xcode and pushing the resulting `.pbxproj` change. |

---

## V1 — Polish milestones (after functionality lands)

| Milestone | Scope |
|---|---|
| **M-polish-theme.** Theme pass | Decide and apply final colors, typography, spacing. If the rest of V1 followed "use tokens, never hardcode," this is a 3-file change. |
| **M-polish-pins.** Custom map pins | Replace Apple's default pins with the final designed `StopAnnotationView`. |
| **M-polish-player.** Player UI polish | The player is the most-watched surface; deserves its own design pass after the rest of the design system is decided. |
| **M-polish-icon.** App icon | Replace the empty Apple template with a real Atlas icon. |
| **M-polish-copy.** Tour descriptions + maker bios review | Editorial-tone pass over launch content. Owner / content team, not Claude. |
| **M-polish-final.** Final V1 success-criteria pass + vibe check | Walk the 9 success criteria in `atlas_claude_code_prompt.md` with the polished app. Last gate before any V1 release. |

---

## Known follow-ups (V1, non-blocking)

Small known gaps that aren't blocking V1 release but should get
picked up during M-qa or the polish phase. (Lifted from
`archive/HANDOFF-260518.md` so they live in a doc that future
sessions actually read.)

- **"Because you searched [X]" home rail.** `RecentSearchStore`
  captures the data but `HomeRailsViewModel` doesn't surface it as
  a rail yet. Wire it up during the post-PR-#20 home-polish pass.
- **`AudioPlayerService` progress aggregation.** `listenedSeconds`
  on `LibraryEntry` currently reflects position within the current
  audio item only — it doesn't aggregate across stops in a
  multi-stop tour. Fine for V1 ("resume listening" works at item
  granularity), worth a real pass before any analytics or
  completion-tracking feature.
- **Custom `AtlasTabBar` tradeoff.** The AllTrails alignment branch
  replaces the system `TabView`'s tab bar with a custom one. That
  gives up system-level features (badge dots, focus animations,
  accessibility heuristics Apple ships). Easy to revisit post-V1
  if any of those bite.

---

## Post-V1 — Future direction (owner takes my lead, reserves right to change)

The big arc after V1 is **opening the platform to outside makers.**
That requires several large pieces of infrastructure, roughly:

### Tier 1 — Unblock the maker side

| | Why first |
|---|---|
| **1. Backend.** Server-stored tours, audio uploads, full CRUD. Stack TBD: managed BaaS (Firebase / Supabase / AWS Amplify) vs. custom DB + REST API. | The static-JSON model doesn't scale past ~50 hand-maintained tours. Every other post-V1 feature depends on this. |
| **2. Maker authentication + maker dashboard.** Sign-up, audio upload, tour metadata editor, per-tour analytics. Likely web-first — editing tours is a desktop task. | No outside makers can ship anything without this. |
| **3. Moderation pipeline.** Report-this-tour, takedown tooling, internal review queue, content policy. | Required before opening uploads to the public — Apple App Store review will ask. |

### Tier 2 — Monetization

| | |
|---|---|
| **4. Paid tours via Apple IAP.** `Tour.priceUSD` flips from 0 to real values; Buy button in consumer app; per-account ownership tracking. Apple takes 30% / 15%; Atlas takes a cut of the remainder; maker gets the rest. | The revenue-share model that the spec calls for. |
| **5. Maker payouts.** Pay makers what they're owed. Stripe Connect is the obvious default for marketplaces of this shape. | Required as soon as paid tours exist. |

### Tier 3 — Consumer-side richness

| | |
|---|---|
| **6. Real sign-in (replaces the V1 placeholder).** Optional sign-in; enables cross-device sync, follow-a-maker, purchase history. Anonymous use still works. | |
| **7. Follow-a-maker + new-tour notifications.** Push when a followed maker publishes a new tour. | |
| **8. In-app search.** Once catalog grows past browsable. | |
| **9. Social — share a tour.** Deep links into a specific tour from a shared URL. | |

### Tier 4 — Platform expansion

| | |
|---|---|
| **10. Reviews / ratings.** Worth weighing — the spec historically excluded them for vibe reasons, but a creator marketplace usually needs quality signals. | |
| **11. Maker collaboration.** Multi-maker tours; joint payouts. | |
| **12. Native experiences on iPad / Mac / Vision Pro.** If consumer demand materializes there. | |

### Open questions for the owner (answer before each tier starts)

- **Tier 1 #1** — backend stack? Firebase / Supabase / custom?
- **Tier 1 #2** — maker dashboard as standalone web app or in-iPad-app?
- **Tier 2 #4** — paid tours per-purchase, subscription, both?
- **Tier 2 #5** — Stripe Connect or another marketplace processor?
- **Tier 3 #6** — Sign in with Apple only, or also email / Google?
- **Tier 4 #10** — do reviews and ratings ship at all, or never?

## Working agreement

- This file is **living**. Edit it whenever the plan changes.
- **Doc hygiene.** Every session that ships a milestone, cuts scope,
  or changes the "what's true today" state of the project updates
  `ROADMAP.md` and `CLAUDE.md` *in the same commit* — never as a
  follow-up. Stale docs poisoned a recent session (Claude reported
  "all milestones done" without knowing about PR #19's redesign);
  the rule prevents a repeat.
- Functionality first; design / tone / icon / polish after.
- New code uses theme tokens even with placeholder values.
- Each milestone ends in a runnable, simulator-reviewable state.
- Owner reviews via simulator or TestFlight, not by reading code.
- If a session uncovers a new gap that isn't in this list, add a new
  milestone rather than expanding an existing one.
- The product spec (`atlas_claude_code_prompt.md`) stays canonical for
  *what* we build. This roadmap is *when* and *how*.
- Temporary "session bridge" notes (like the original `HANDOFF.md`)
  don't live at repo root — fold their permanent content into
  `ROADMAP.md` / `CLAUDE.md` and move the snapshot to `archive/`
  with a `YYMMDD` suffix.
