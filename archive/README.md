# archive/

Snapshots of working docs from earlier in the project. Naming
convention: `<original-name>-YYMMDD.md`, where the date is the day
the snapshot was archived (or the day it represents, for handoffs).

**Reading rule.** Most files here are historical — not read at
session start; anything still relevant to current work belongs in
`CLAUDE.md` or `ROADMAP.md`. **Exception: the most recent
`HANDOFF-YYMMDD.md` is part of the session-start ritual** (see
`CLAUDE.md` § "Session-start ritual"). It bridges the gap between
durable project rules and the specific mid-flight state from the
prior session — queued user feedback, what was about to be tackled,
tribal knowledge not yet promoted.

| File | Purpose | Date |
|---|---|---|
| `HANDOFF-260519.md` | **Active handoff.** End-of-day snapshot from the 2026-05-19 remote session (work computer, no Mac access): TestFlight prep landed (icon + encryption setting + design-tokens doc, PR #36); App Store Connect browser-side setup completed; 7 new real tours added (PRs #37–43, #45); ROADMAP expanded with maker-platform deep dive (PR #46) and `M-rethink-categories` (PR #44). Read at session start. | 2026-05-19 |
| `HANDOFF-260518.md` | End-of-day snapshot from the 2026-05-18 session. Historical — superseded by the 5/19 handoff as active. Kept for context on what shipped that day (AllTrails-style home, unit test target wiring, session-start ritual, P0 audit closure). | 2026-05-18 |
| `pre-qa-audit-260518.md` | Pre-QA code self-audit (22 findings, P0–P3). Produced under PR #21; most P0 + 2 P1 findings closed by PRs #22 / #23 / #24. Remaining findings tracked as live checklist in `ROADMAP.md` § M-qa. | 2026-05-18 |

When the next handoff is written, name it for the new date
(`HANDOFF-YYMMDD.md`) and update the entry above to point to the
latest one as the "Active handoff." Older handoffs stay as
historical entries, but only the latest is part of the session-start
ritual.
