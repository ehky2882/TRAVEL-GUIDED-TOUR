# CLAUDE.md

## Project: Atlas

GPS-anchored audio tour platform. Makers record audio; consumers browse, download, and play while walking — audio auto-triggers at each stop. Closer to AllTrails than a guidebook.

**Spec:** `atlas_claude_code_prompt.md` — read before product decisions.
**Execution plan:** `ROADMAP.md` — read before implementation decisions.
**V1:** Consumer-side only. No backend, auth, payments, or maker upload.

Multi-platform SwiftUI. iOS 26.2 / macOS 26.2 / visionOS 26.2.

## Claude Automation Rules

These happen **automatically, without the owner asking**.

| # | Trigger | What Claude does automatically |
|---|---------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | Every session start | Run full git/PR health check (§ Session-start ritual) + read latest HANDOFF file — before any other work |
| 2 | After any edit to `Resources/Tours.json` | Run `swift scripts/validate-tours.swift`; fix errors before continuing |
| 3 | Before pushing any code PR | Call `test_sim` (XcodeBuildMCP); fix failures before pushing |
| 4 | Any PR is ready (CI green) | Squash-merge to `main` automatically — no owner approval gate. Resolve merge conflicts in-line without prompting (unless they require a business-logic decision — see § Merging PRs). Delete the merged branch. Owner reviews via TestFlight downstream. |
| 5 | Session ends (touched code or content) | Update `CLAUDE.md` + `ROADMAP.md` in same commit; write `archive/HANDOFF-YYMMDD.md`; update `archive/README.md` |
| 6 | Stale merged `claude/*` branches detected | Delete them via `git push origin --delete` — no prompting |
| 7 | Owner asks for a TestFlight build | Bump `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.pbxproj`, commit + push, then run `xcodebuild archive` (see `docs/testflight.md` § "Archive command"). Owner then does Organizer → Distribute App → Upload (2–3 min). |

## Current State (2026-05-24)

V1 functionality complete and device-validated. TestFlight build **1.0 (7)** uploading now (owner archives from Xcode).

PR #61 (mini-player end-of-tour state — `c054a67`) shipped 2026-05-24 pm: kills the post-tour "Loading…"/hourglass flicker and adds in-place replay via new `AudioPlayerService.replayLast()`. PR #60 (home polish bundle + player-state hardening — `e5b31da`) shipped 2026-05-24 late-pm: bigger bottom-module radius (48→56), drawer now stacks on top of mini-player + tab bar via new `bottomReservedHeight`, chip + search-bar share `searchBarHeight = 46`, "tours in view" count + `Let's explore together!` empty state, recenter button tracks drawer detent. Same PR also fixed three player-state bugs surfaced during visual review: Open-player button no longer disabled mid-load, `seek(to:)` synthesizes `.ended` on scrub-to-end (AVPlayer doesn't fire `didPlayToEndTime` on manual seek), full-player tap-to-replay on `.ended` via new `replayCurrent()`.

**What's left:** author one multi-stop walking tour (unblocks the last M-qa checks) → broader design/polish pass.

Key facts:
- **38 single-stop tours** in `Resources/Tours.json`; audio on `gh-pages` at `https://ehky2882.github.io/TRAVEL-GUIDED-TOUR/audio/<file>.mp3`
- **All 38 tours have `heroImageURL`** — CC-licensed Wikimedia Commons landscape photos (committed 2026-05-23/24). Whitney and MAD have no landscape exterior on Commons; best available used.
- `MiniPlayerBar` above tab bar at all times: marquee titles, skip-forward-10s, progress ring, idle welcome message
- `MarqueeText.swift` in `Components/` — scrolls overflow text continuously
- AppIcon is placeholder (green sphere); AccentColor: terracotta `#B85042` (placeholder)
- Theme tokens in `Theme/Atlas*.swift` are placeholder values pending design pass
- `UIBackgroundModes=audio` now in explicit `Info.plist` (not INFOPLIST_KEY — Xcode ignores that for arrays)

See `ROADMAP.md` for full milestone history. Read latest `archive/HANDOFF-*.md` for mid-flight context.

## Session-start ritual (automatic — Claude runs this first, every session)

```bash
git fetch && git status && git branch --show-current && git log origin/main..HEAD && gh pr list --state open
ls archive/HANDOFF-*.md | tail -1   # then read that file
```

Run before any substantive work. Investigate uncommitted changes before acting on them.

## Merging PRs

**Auto-merge all PRs that pass CI (squash, no owner approval).** This includes code PRs (`*.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`/`*.pbxproj`, `Assets.xcassets/`) — owner reviews via TestFlight after the fact, not before merge. Flow: open PR → wait for CI green → `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`.

**Merge conflicts: resolve them automatically.** When merging or rebasing produces a conflict, Claude resolves it without prompting. Pure structural conflicts (file renames, neighboring edits, import reorderings, doc reformats, version-number bumps) are always auto-resolved. Only stop and ask if the conflict reflects a real business-logic disagreement two PRs are taking different positions on (e.g. two PRs implementing the same feature differently) — surface the choice before resolving.

**Exceptions — still wait for owner OK:**
- Anything that adds an `Info.plist` capability key the owner hasn't asked for (`UIBackgroundModes` additions, `NSAppTransportSecurity`, etc.)
- Anything that bumps the deployment target
- Anything that introduces a third-party dependency
- Anything that changes signing identity / team / bundle ID

## Keep Docs in Sync (automatic — no prompting needed)

Every session that ships a milestone, cuts scope, or changes "what's true today" must update `CLAUDE.md` + `ROADMAP.md` in the same commit. Write `archive/HANDOFF-YYMMDD.md` + update `archive/README.md` at session end if code or content was touched. Non-negotiable.

## Repo Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `atlas_claude_code_prompt.md` | Canonical product spec |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Execution plan + milestone history |
| `docs/authoring-tours.md` | Tour content authoring guide |
| `docs/cdn-decision.md` | Audio hosting decision |
| `docs/design-tokens.md` | Typography/color/spacing reference |
| `docs/testflight.md` | Per-release upload runbook (~10 min) |
| `docs/troubleshooting.md` | Xcode + git landmines from real incidents |
| `scripts/validate-tours.swift` | Validates `Tours.json`; run: `swift scripts/validate-tours.swift` |
| `TRAVEL GUIDED TOURTests/` | 6 XCTest classes, data/logic layer |
| `archive/` | Dated session snapshots |

**`validate-tours.swift` mirrors `Tour/Stop/Maker/TourCategory.swift` — update the script in the same commit if any model changes.**

## Build & Run

Use **XcodeBuildMCP tools** — prefer over raw `xcodebuild` shell commands.

| Task | XcodeBuildMCP tool |
|------|--------------------|
| Verify session defaults | `session_show_defaults` — **call first every session before any build/test** |
| Build for iOS Simulator | `build_sim` |
| Build + launch in Simulator | `build_run_sim` |
| Run unit tests | `test_sim` |
| Take simulator screenshot | `screenshot` |

**Run `test_sim` automatically before pushing any code PR.** Skip for doc-only, CI-only, `Features/`/`Components/`/`Theme/`-only, or `Tours.json` content-only changes.

Fallback raw commands (CI + macOS builds):
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme "TRAVEL GUIDED TOUR" -configuration Debug build
xcodebuild test -scheme "TRAVEL GUIDED TOUR" \
  -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=latest" -configuration Debug
```

Environment services (instantiated once at app entry, injected via SwiftUI Environment — never in views): `DataService`, `LibraryStore`, `RecentSearchStore`, `RecentlyViewedStore`, `LocationManager`, `AudioPlayerService`, `TourDownloader`.

## Conventions

- `@Observable` not `ObservableObject`. `NavigationStack` not `NavigationView`.
- Hero images: use `Components/HeroImageView.swift` — never raw `AsyncImage`.
- Audio: always through `AudioPlayerService`. Never create `AVPlayer` in a view.
- No third-party libraries in V1. Apple frameworks only: SwiftUI, MapKit, CoreLocation, AVFoundation, MediaPlayer, SwiftData/UserDefaults.
- Design tokens: use `AtlasColors.*`, `AtlasTypography.*`, `AtlasSpacing.*`. No hardcoded colors/fonts/padding.
- Support Dynamic Type and Dark Mode.

## Design System

Tokens in `Theme/` are single source of truth; values are placeholders pending deferred design pass. Accent `#B85042` is also placeholder. Build for function first.

## Build Config

- Bundle ID: `com.ehky.TRAVEL-GUIDED-TOUR`
- Swift 5.0; deployment targets iOS 26.2 / macOS 26.2 / visionOS 26.2
- Device families: iPhone, iPad, Apple Vision; code signing automatic, team `CPC7M72JTP`
- `Info.plist` at repo root (explicit file — `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = NO`)
- Keys: `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `UIBackgroundModes=audio`, `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=NO`

## Out of Scope for V1

No: backend/API, user accounts/auth, in-app maker upload, payments/IAP, moderation, comments/reviews/ratings, follow/sharing/social, push notifications (local geofence notifications OK), onboarding tutorial, in-app search, analytics SDK. Don't introduce any without a spec update.
